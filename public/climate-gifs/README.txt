CLIMATE CHANGE VISUALIZATION GIFs

For this project, you need to add three climate change visualization GIFs:

1. Sea Level Rise:
   - File: sea-level-rise.gif
   - Content: A GIF showing coastal areas with gradual sea level rise
   - The code will control playback position based on the year slider

2. Drought Conditions:
   - File: drought-progression.gif
   - Content: A GIF showing landscape transitioning from normal to drought conditions
   - The code applies filters to enhance the effect as the year increases

3. Wildfire Risk:
   - File: wildfire-progression.gif
   - Content: A GIF showing increasing wildfire intensity
   - The code applies saturation and contrast effects based on the year

Sources for Climate Visualization GIFs:

- NOAA Climate: https://www.climate.gov/
- Climate Central: https://www.climatecentral.org/
- GIPHY (search for climate change visualizations)

Place the GIFs in this folder with exactly these filenames.

Note: If you don't have access to create these specific GIFs, you can use placeholder images or GIFs temporarily. The code includes CSS effects that will help simulate the progression even with static images.
